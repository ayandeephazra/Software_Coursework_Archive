a.c -> does exit perfectly, ls is confusing thus commented out

b.c -> does ls but prints wish> then the expected output ?

c.c -> unexplained segfaults, dead end

d.c -> new approach continuing from a.c. Found out reason for segfault. Changed in c.c too. d started out as as savestate of c.c.

      for (int j = 0; j < tokenCount; j++)
            {
                printf("%i %s\n", j, commands[j]);
            }

EXIT WORKS!!!!

e.c -> cd works! added error case to cd, path also works now! only non built in left.

f.c -> non in-built woes
