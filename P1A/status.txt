y has done all command except for d,key. some of the commands do not update the databse values in the end. 

z is very buggy, delete does not work, clear does not work, new file not made
z does not put elements onto empty file, but can put elements onto used file

a is a dumpster fire

b is just y

./b p,45,haley p,35,martin p,30,arbitha p,25,hansen p,195,mark

./b p,46,liam p,44,sanders p,59,leonard p,21,merc 

b completely does everything in p,g,c,a just d is left

c is again dumpster fire

d actually works (except the d,key is unfinished) and bug where first put statement cannot immediately be retrived using get

e is trying to implement d,key => is a failed approach to d,key

f is 90% done, just inputs on the same line need tuning, eg) p,45,ark g,45 does not work if file is empty

g just puts the loadTXT in the foor loop to ensure what failed above works,

h ensures that bob.txt does not need to be in the environment before the fact, neither does temp.txt
h is good till we get remzi's tests. h deletes all instances of a key if multiple exist.

fix the issue in i, check piazza

   else
        {
            printf("here");
            if (strcmp((curr->next->pair).key, (n->pair).key) == 0)
            {
                printf("here");
                strcpy((curr->next->pair).value, (n->pair).value);
                return;
            }
        }

i fails to handle multiple key, follow logic in delete block, by opening a new file and copying it instead of renaming.
i keeps deleting bob.txt midway thru.

j modularized the delete function so add could use it. add was debugged successfully, duplicates resolved.

k passed all of remzi's tests LESSGO
